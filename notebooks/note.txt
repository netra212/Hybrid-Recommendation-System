Collaborative Filtering: we don't shown content on the basis of user history. 
In Collaborative filtering, we calculate the similarity between the user and items. 
If between users --> User based CF.
If between items --> Item based CF.

Song A --> Converted into the vectors. similar for the other songs as well. 
Then cosine similarity will be calculate. 

Vectors is made on songs artist, attrbutes, and metadata.

But in Collaborative, we calcualte the vector in user liking, rating, playcount. so we calculate the similarity between the above mentioned.
